# sdv-price-catalogue

## About

This mod developed with Content Patcher, adds a crafting recipe for a Price Catalogue to the crafting menu. Using just one fiber, you can craft the catalogue right at the start of the game. With the Price Catalogue, you can view the sell prices of all items, making it easier to plan your farming, foraging, and trading strategies.

## Recommendation

The design intent of this mod is aligned with CJB Show Item Sell Price. It's a much better choice if you want to maintain the original gameplay experience. You can find it here: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5
